# pyplume v1.0

Pyplume calculates a numerical solution to the equations formulated for a
point source plume released at the base of a vertical wall. The code includes
capabilities for calculating the melt rate in the case where the vertical wall
is made of ice.

An interactive jupyter notebook demonstrating how to use the code with a uniform
ambient stratification can be launched on mybinder.org with the following link:

More examples and documentation will be added shortly.

The code was developed by Alistair Everett with inspiration from Tom Cowton's iceplume Fortran model (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JC010324)
